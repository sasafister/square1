# How to launch this app

First run ```composer install ```
Then run ```npm install ```

I've created Laravel command for Admin user. You can run it like:
```php artisan created:admin ```

Then if you are not using Laravel Vale, you should go with 
``` php artisan serve ```

and visit ```localhost:8000```

Then, register and have fun.

This is just a Proof of Concpet (POC), to show you some of my skills. I didn't go to deep into Laravel, but I did use some desing pattern like Interfaces for importing posts, so it's easy to swap logic if it's needed. Also I wrote little test to make sure that provided API is working.

```vendor/bin/phpunit ```

## About Me

From early age, I was interested in writing code. My father bought Sinclair ZX Spectrum + when I was in first grade, and few year later I wrote my first program. I was impressed but not commited to learn more. Back then, programming was nothing compare what is it today. I later discovered that I pretty much love writing code, so I'm doing it now for 6 years constantly. I love it every minute, even tough we all know how sometimes coding can be hard.

In my spare time, I'm building tennis platform Sliceer:

- [Sliceer website](https://www.sliceer.com).

It's build on top of Laravel / Vue / Tailwind stack. 

## Learning Programming

I learn as much as I can. I like exploring new things and technologies, learning in general because of my curious spirit. 

## Background

I had 3 companies, of which two I sold [ZIMO] (https://zimo.dnevnik.hr) which is tech blog started in 2010, sold in 2016 to biggest media company in Croatia (NovaTV). I had several business like selling Apple products through webshop.
